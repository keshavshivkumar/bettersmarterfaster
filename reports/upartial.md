# $U_{partial}$

## Overview

- The $U_{partial}$ refers to the expected utility of a state wherein the prey's position is replaced with a vector of beliefs of where it might be.
- In this case, the prey's position is unknown. This means that the prey's different beliefs result in an infinite number of belief states that causes $U^{*}$ to be tough to compute.

## Design

- The idea here is to compute $U_{partial}$ as an estimate from $U^{*}$ as provided in the writeup:
$U_{partial}(s_{agent}, s_{predator}, p) = \sum_{s_{prey}} p_{s_{prey}} U^{*}(s_{agent}, s_{predator}, s_{prey})$
- An agent is designed to follow the estimated utility generated by the aforementioned equation.

## Implementation

- Using the `belief` dictionary, which contains the non-zero beliefs of the prey's position, for a given state configuration, the estimated utility `upartial` is computed.
- The state [`upartial`, agent_position, predator_position, prey_vector] is stored in `upartial.csv` if `upartial` < 50, since if the estimate is greater than 50, it means that the path is not an optimal one. 
- For each `upartial` computed, the probabilities of the predator's next move is also taken into account, and the action that provides the smallest `upartial` is chosen by the $U_{partial}$ agent.

## Observations

- The agent's performance was close to the $U^*$ agent, almost always around a 99-100% win rate.

# $V_{partial}$#

## Overview

- $V_{partial}# or `VpartialSharp` is the neural network model built to predict the value of `UpartialSharp`.

## Design

- `VpartialSharp` does not differ from `Vpartial` except in the aspect of input.
- Similar to how `Vpartial` gets its input, `VpartialSharp` gets its input from `usharp.csv` that was generated by `UpartialSharp`.

## Implementation

- `VpartialSharp` does not differ from `Vpartial` in implementation.

## Observations

- The average win rate for the agent is 99.8%.
- The average # of timesteps was 29.3609.
- Its performance is no different from the `UpartialSharp` agent, and is thus not notably different from the `Upartial` and `Vpartial` agents.

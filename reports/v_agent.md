# V Model

## Overview

- The V model is a model that is built to predict the value of U*(s) for a state s âˆŠ state space S.

## Design

- The V model is a regression neural network model that is made of 1 input layer, 3 hidden layers and 1 output layer.
- The output layer outputs the predicted U* value for each state.
- Using the output of the V model, an agent can be constructed to attempt to catch the prey in the graph.

## Implementation

### V model

- The V model is trained using the U-table as input, which contains the calculated U* values for each state.
- The input is passed as a NumPy array of arrays. The features (columns), as specified before, are stored in each sub-array (rows).
- There are 6 features passed as input to the neural network: the agent's position node, the prey's position node, the predator's position node, the distance between the agent and prey positions, the distance between the prey and predator positions, and the distance between the predator and agent positions.
- The weight and bias are numpy arrays initialized to random standard normalized values.
- There are 2 types of layers that are used:
    - Linear (Fully Connected) Layer
    - Activation Layer
- The layers are arranged in the following order: input | activation | linear | activation | output
- Different activation and loss functions and optimizers were trialed. 
- The activation function used is Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) and the loss function used is Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
- Adam optimizer was used. 
- // backpropogation
- 
- The V model is trained for 5,000 epochs.

### V Agent

- The V Agent bootstraps off the predictions made by the V model.

### Observations

- The loss of the training converged to 0._
- The agent performed with an accuracy of 100%.
